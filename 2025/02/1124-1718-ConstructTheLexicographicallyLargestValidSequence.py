1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence
Medium

Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

    The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
    Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
    For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.

The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: [3,1,2,3,2]
Explanation: [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 20

Hint 1
Heuristic algorithm may work.
