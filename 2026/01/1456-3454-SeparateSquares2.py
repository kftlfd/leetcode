3454. Separate Squares II
Hard

You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.

Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line equals the total area covered by squares below the line.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted only once in this version.

 

Example 1:

Input: squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]

Output: 1.00000

Explanation:

Any horizontal line between y = 1 and y = 2 results in an equal split, with 1 square unit above and 1 square unit below. The minimum y-value is 1.

Example 2:

Input: squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]]

Output: 1.00000

Explanation:

Since the blue square overlaps with the red square, it will not be counted again. Thus, the line y = 1 splits the squares into two equal parts.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 10^4
    squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]
    squares[i].length == 3
    0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9
    1 <= li <= 10^9
    The total area of all the squares will not exceed 10^15.


Hint 1
Use a line sweep and a segment tree.
Hint 2
The line must lie in one of the squares.
