1512. Number of Good Pairs (easy)
2023-10-03

Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs.

A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0

 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    1 <= nums[i] <= 100

Hint:
Count how many times each number appears. If a number appears n times, then n * (n â€“ 1) // 2 good pairs can be made with this number.
