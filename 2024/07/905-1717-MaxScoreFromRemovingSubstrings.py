1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings
Medium
2024-07-12

You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

    Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
        For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
    Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
        For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".

Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
Output: 19
Explanation:
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
Output: 20

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    1 <= x, y <= 10^4
    s consists of lowercase English letters.
